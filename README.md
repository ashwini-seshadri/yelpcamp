# YelpCamp

This project was a part of [Colt Steele's web development course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy.

YelpCamp is a website where users can create and review campgrounds. 
In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account.

This website was created using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.
